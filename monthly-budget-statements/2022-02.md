Notes:

*Compensation: Forecast increase reflects additional FTEs in the team from March onwards.

*Professional services: Legal services for lender review of borrower structures/contracts were previously under-budgetted given complexity and cost of high-quality firms to assess deals.

*Professional services forecast has been updated to reflect 250K/transaction cost of legal review. Forecasted rump up will be 1.5x transactions in March followed by 2x transactions/month subsequently. 

*Payment fees increase linearly with cost increase, legal primarily.
*Travel Costs: EthDenver participation for 3 team members. Only 1 reflect in Feb actuals.

**MIP budget in Poll Ratification stage. Professional services costs from external legal consultations account for most of the change in the budget. From March new budget under MIP40 to be reported.

**Budget forecast for MIP increase to reflect legal cost estimates.
