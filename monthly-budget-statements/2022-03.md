Notes:

*Compensation: Forecast increase reflects additional FTEs in the team from April onwards.

*Professional services: Legal services for lender review of borrower structures/contracts were previously under-budgetted given complexity and cost of high-quality firms to assess deals.

*Professional services forecast has been updated to reflect 250K/transaction cost of legal review. Forecasted rump up will be 1.5x transactions in March followed by a staged increase in subsequent months. 

*Payment fees are variable costs. It increases linearly with expenses increase, legal primarily.

*DD costs: Includes previously unforecasted physical visit to borrower facilities as part of DD. Contigency buffer is used to cover such costs.

**MIP budget approved. From March new budget under MIP40 is reported. Professional services (legal) account for highest share of budget.
